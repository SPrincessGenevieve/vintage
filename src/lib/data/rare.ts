            "The 2016 Bolgheri Superiore Ornellaia is a wine of extreme complexity and precision. It offers monumental depth with profound layers of black fruit, coffee, licorice and baking chocolate. I tasted this 2016 vintage beside the less-impactful 2015 vintage (which was reviewed last year). These two editions are very different when compared side to side, and this 2016 release is clearly superior in terms of the quality, clarity and intensity of its offerings. This Ornellaia delivers glossy shine and a polished texture that segues to important richness, concentration and textural fiber. It wraps thickly over the palate, imparting waves of sweet dark fruit and dark spice that linger for many long minutes. This beautiful wine is hitting the market now, but collectors will want to put it straight into their cellars for safekeeping.",

            "The 2016 Bolgheri Sassicaia is a wine of soaring achievement. I tasted this wine several times during the course of its creation in both barrel and bottle, and the highly deserved 100-point score you see here was enthusiastically assigned at the conclusion of a mini vertical in which I tasted and compared the 2016 vintage against 2015 (which I scored 97 points). It makes perfect sense to present these two excellent vintages in back-to-back comparison fashion because they are two of the best to emerge from Bolgheri, and indeed Tenuta San Guido, in recent memory. These are very similar vintages with long, hot summer months that fueled a long growing season. There was a bit more rain in 2016, and in analytical terms this vintage has a tad more acidity. However, the results in the glass are extraordinarily different. The 2015 vintage is exuberant, round, succulent and immediate, whereas the 2016 vintage shows pinpoint sharpness and precision (with similar grit and texture at the back). That acidity will carry it long into the future as the wine completes its slow evolutionary course. This wine is chiseled and sharp with blackberry, ripe cherry, grilled herb and barbecue spice. The aromas flow from the glass in a continuous stream and are all marked by radiant intensity. The mouthfeel is long and powerful. The crisp linearity of the wine's tannic backbone is perfectly measured to the volume and depth of the fruit flavors. To my mind, the 2016 Sassicaia stands tall next to the epic 1985 vintage that set the ultimate benchmark for vino italiano.",

            "Masseto has pulled off back-to-back home runs. This is the first time that an Italian wine has earned 100 points in successive vintages. The 2016 Masseto is a thunderstorm of emotions, but it manages to keep them under perfect control. Like the 2015 Masseto before it, this vintage is a seamless wine of the highest pedigree. It represents an encore performance, continuing the string of successes that is bringing Italy to the forefront of the wine world. The first thing you'll notice is the thickness and concentration of the fruit that makes an immediate impact on all the senses, in terms of appearance, aroma and mouthfeel. There is no overstating the sheer power and richness of this iconic vintage of Italy's groundbreaking Merlot. Despite that considerable mass, this Masseto remains delicate and graceful. You gain better perspective as the wine opens in the glass and reveals deeper layers that were not immediately apparent on first nose: dark fruit, spice, sweet tobacco and black cherry. There is great tightness and laser focus to the fruit. I tasted the 2016 and 2015 vintages together for comparison when I scored this wine, and then I tasted this 2016 edition alone about a month later to confirm my impressions. These vintages are identical twins, two perfect wines.",

            "I fussed over scoring this wine more than I'd like to admit—tasting through three samples under different conditions at various intervals and testing my impressions blind against wines in its peer group. Most importantly, I tasted this 2016 vintage against the 2015 vintage over and over again. I confess to a few nights of restless sleep as a result. Ultimately, my decision to award 100 points to the 2016 Solaia came on impulse and with the most natural sense of purpose. I had also given the 2015 vintage a perfect score, and intellectually, it seemed impossible not to pick a favorite among these two stunning expressions. I will also state, outright, that the wines are very different, principally because the 2015 vintage shows more overall opulence and sweetness that extends to the pronounced textural richness of the mouthfeel. The 2016 vintage, on the other hand, is more chiseled and sharp with mineral shadings of campfire ash and graphite at the rim of its dark fruit. The mouthfeel is more streamlined and tight at its core, suggesting that the wine will unfold and soften beautifully with time. I feel like 2015 is the Dolce & Gabbana of the situation and the 2016 is the Armani Privé. The personalities of the two wines are distinct, yet my admiration for each is identical.",

        "This is the stuff of dreams. Tasted so young, I did a lot of coaxing to nudge the wine along, thanks to a double decant and a few extra hours in an open bottle. I tasted both samples I had over the course of a few weeks. Those efforts served well, but the wine remains packed tight and full of nervous energy regardless, indicating that its true potential won't be seen for another 10 or 20 years, or likely more. The Bartolo Mascarello 2016 Barolo is a true icon of the vintage. The approach is elongated and silky, like lifting honey from a jar. The aromas are chiseled and focused with wild berry, licorice, candied orange peel, campfire ash, rusted iron, crushed graphite and pencil shaving. The wine's personality is downplayed, elegant and demure in one tasting but exuberant and expressive in the next. The tannins show snap and crunch, indicating they will drive the wine forward over many years of cellar age. This is one of those rare wines that is poised to improve with each increment of time. Structurally, it is perfect. If we were to create a template for an aspirational Barolo, this would be it.",

Known for its "tar and roses" aroma, firm tannins, and high acidity, Barolo develops complex flavors of truffles and dark chocolate with age. Key subregions like La Morra and Serralunga d\'Alba produce distinct styles, from aromatic to robust. Barolo must age at least 38 months (62 for Riserva). Modernists favor fruitier, earlier-drinking styles, sparking the ongoing "Barolo Wars" between tradition and innovation.',

The estate gained global recognition under Bartolo Mascarello, a staunch traditionalist who opposed modern winemaking trends like French oak barriques and single-vineyard bottlings. His iconic "No Barrique, No Berlusconi" label highlighted his political views and commitment to tradition. Now led by his daughter Maria-Teresa Mascarello, the estate blends grapes from Cannubi, San Lorenzo, Rué, and Rocche dell\'Annunziata. Wines are elegant, aged in Slavonian oak botti, with annual Barolo production around 1,250 cases.',

Saturnine at first, it responds to aeration, opening up with minimal encouragement and gaining more and more intensity. The palate is what you might call a bold and brassy style of Clos de Tart - upfront fruit, muscular, forthright tannin and enormous depth on the finish that fans out gloriously.

        "Pinot Noir is a highly revered and complex red grape variety, known for producing elegant, aromatic wines with flavours of red berries, cherries, and earthy undertones. Its thin skin results in lighter colour and softer tannins, making it versatile yet challenging to cultivate. Burgundy, particularly Côte de Nuits, is its spiritual home, though it thrives globally in regions like Oregon, California, and New Zealand. Pinot Noir pairs beautifully with dishes like roast duck, salmon, and creamy pastas, reflecting its refined yet adaptable character.",
      region:
        "Clos de Tart is a prestigious Grand Cru vineyard in Morey-Saint-Denis, Côte de Nuits, Burgundy. Established in the 12th century, it has been a monopole since its inception, now owned by François Pinault since 2017. The 7.5-hectare vineyard is planted entirely with Pinot Noir, divided into six distinct blocks with limestone and marl soils, offering southeast exposure. Clos de Tart wines are renowned for their balance of power and elegance, while lesser wines are declassified as La Forge Premier Cru.",
      winery:
        "Clos de Tart, a prestigious grand cru monopole in Morey-Saint-Denis, Côte de Nuits, Burgundy, exclusively produces two acclaimed Pinot Noir wines: Clos de Tart Grand Cru and La Forge de Tart Premier Cru. Founded in the 12th century by Cistercian nuns, it has remained a monopole since. Covering 7.5 hectares, the vineyard's southeast-facing slopes are divided into six parcels, each vinified separately to highlight microclimates. Acquired by François Pinault’s Artemis Group in 2017, Clos de Tart continues to produce elegant, complex wines, solidifying its place among Burgundy’s elite estates.",

        "Two bottles were badly corked, which is certainly a scary situation for a wine where only 1,000 or so cases were produced. However, a third bottle was magical and just short of perfection. Its saturated purple color was followed by a surprisingly more evolved and open wine than I had written in my tasting note in 2003, where I predicted maturity between 2020 and 2075. This wine displays wonderful, sweet tannin and a big, sweet kiss of truffle, crushed rock, blueberry, blackberry, and licorice. Extremely rich, full-bodied, with astonishing power, precision, and delicacy, this is a sumptuous wine that should age well for 50-60 years, but in the case of the one bottle out of three that was not corked, it seemed far more evolved and forward than I suggested in my write-up in 2003.",

        'The term "Bordeaux Blend", whilst not legally defined, is widely used to describe wines that combine traditional Bordeaux grape varieties, primarily Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Unlike its American counterpart "Meritage", it lacks official recognition but serves as a useful international reference for Bordeaux-style red wines. These blends are characterised by powerful structure, deep fruit flavours, and firm tannins. Though originating in France, the style has spread globally, with vineyards worldwide crafting their interpretations. The term\'s flexibility is both its strength and potential weakness.',
      region:
        "Saint-Émilion is a prominent Bordeaux Right Bank appellation known for its Merlot-based red wines, producing over 250,000hl annually. The region's vineyards, dating back to Roman times, are divided into three main areas: a limestone plateau housing most prestigious estates, a southern alluvial plain, and a northwestern gravelly terrace. Unlike Médoc's Cabernet Sauvignon focus, Saint-Émilion favours Merlot and Cabernet Franc due to its cooler, clay-chalk soils. The area features four satellite regions and operates a controversial classification system, from which several top estates recently withdrew.",
      winery:
        "Château Ausone is a prestigious Saint-Émilion estate named after a 4th-century Roman poet. Despite its small size of seven hectares, it's considered one of Bordeaux's finest producers. Located on a steep, southeast-facing slope near Saint-Émilion town, the vineyard primarily grows Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Though it withdrew from the Saint-Émilion classification in 2022, it remains highly regarded. With limited production of under 2,000 cases annually and consistent critical acclaim since the 1990s, Ausone is among Saint-Émilion's most expensive and sought-after wines.",
