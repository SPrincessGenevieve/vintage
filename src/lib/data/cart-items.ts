        "The 2002 Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill is the stunning 2008's closest challenger in the decade, bursting with aromas of confit citrus, stone fruits, mandarin, sweet dried fruits, smoke and iodine. Full-bodied, layered and vinous, it's deep and multidimensional, with broad shoulders, terrific concentration and a long, resonant finish. In style, this shares all of 2012's breadth and flesh but brings more structure and tension to the equation. Still youthful today, the 2002 will drink well for the next two decades from a cold cellar.",

        "This blend of 92% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot (note that rarely is any Merlot utilized at the historic Napanook Estate in Yountville). The alcohol, by California standards, is a relatively modest 14.1%. Blending the best of French savoir faire with the brilliant fruit purity and ripeness of Napa Valley, Moueix has turned in another tour de force that seems far superior today than it did when it was first released. This is one of the vintage’s greatest wines. Dense purple and youthful, with a glorious nose of earth, blackcurrants, sweet black cherries and incense, the oak is pushed way in the background, as it is in all of the Moueix wines, and the result is a wine of terroir, of great originality and authenticity. This full-bodied classic from Dominus can be drunk now, but really won’t hit its prime for another 4-5 years and last at least another two decades or more.",

Established in 1982 by Christian Moueix, a Bordeaux vintner famous for his work with Pétrus, the estate centers on the historic Napanook Vineyard, first planted by George Yount in 1838. Dominus' flagship wine blends Cabernet Sauvignon with Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, reflecting the vineyard’s plantings. The estate also produces the mid-tier Napanook and entry-level Othello wines. Dominus is dry-farmed, with a focus on low yields and quality, and features a distinctive, stone-filled gabion winery designed for natural temperature control.",

        "Tasted at the pre-dinner vertical to mark Sylvain Pitiot's retirement from the domaine, the 2002 Clos de Tart Grand Cru has long been one of my favorite vintages from this monopole, and at 13-years-old it shows no signs of losing that place in my heart. The bouquet is just so pure and refined, reminiscent of the 2005 in some way, albeit with not quite the same intensity. However, the detail is breathtaking - one of those bouquets that whisks you straight to its place of birth, within those ancient stone walls in Morey-Saint-Denis. The palate is brilliantly balanced, utterly refined with lace-like tannin, perfectly pitched acidity and a gentle build in the mouth towards a glorious, saline-tinged finish that hangs like the final piano chord in an empty hall. Wondrous - perhaps the high point of Pitiot's tenure?",

        "Having followed this wine's evolution in barrel for the past few years, it is an honor to evaluate the final product. This Sassicaia has blossomed since my previous encounters with it as a young, awkward adolescent. The long-awaited 2015 Bolgheri Sassicaia represents a tremendous effort that comes together with seamless precision and focus. This is a confident and proud red wine from Tuscany. Starting with the primary material at hand, you sense the quality of fruit thanks to the wine's beautifully dark appearance and the rich texture it offers to the palate. The acidity is integrated, but more freshness still would have been welcomed in my view (and would also contribute to its longevity). The bouquet is amplified both in terms of volume and length. Its playlist includes dark berry fruit, spice, leather, licorice and roasted coffee bean. Yet, the mouthfeel is extremely graceful and silky. The wine's undisputed pedigree is showcased on the palate. It should also be noted that this edition of Sassicaia feels more ready and open to me. It will age and evolve beautifully, but the 2015 Sassicaia can also be enjoyed in the medium-term. This wine is all about the here and now.",

        "The 2001 Barolo (from magnum) offers up licorice, tobacco, smoke, plums and prunes. The fruit has begun to fade, yielding to early tertiary scents as this medium-bodied wine continues to open up over time. The 2001 has more than enough depth and persistence to drink well for a number of years, but it is also more forward than I expected. Stylistically, the 2001 is on the delicate side, and does not appear to be built for the long haul. This is a period when the Mascarello wines were inconsistent, something proprietor Maria-Theresa Mascarello has addressed in a big way over the last few years. As it turns out, I also tasted a magnum of the 1993 next to the 2001 and found it much more youthful, rich and ageworthy. There is little question which of the two vintages I would prefer to own.
